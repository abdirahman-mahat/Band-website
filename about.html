    <h1>IRON MAIDEN BAND</h1>
    <p>
      Iron Maiden was formed in May 1975 by bassist Steve Harris, who joined up with guitarist Dave Murray a few months later. Thirty years later, the two remain at the helm of Iron Maiden.


      The Early Years
      Harris and Murray went through a ridiculous number of bandmembers throughout the 1970s, paying their dues on the mostly punk club circuit in London's rough East End neighbourhood. Though Maiden were a metal band influenced by Deep Purple, Yes, Wishbone Ash, and Black Sabbath, they did possess a fast, punkish style in the early days. Original singer Paul Day was much punkier than his replacement, the outlandish Dennis Wilcock, a huge Kiss fan that used fire, makeup, and fake blood onstage. By 1978, Harris and Murray had estabilised the Iron Maiden line-up with the addition of drummer Doug Sampson and vocalist Paul Di'Anno.

      If the band had sounded punk before, they did even more so with the arrival of the short-haired, fiery Di'Anno. For years, the band had been pressured by record labels to cut their hair and sacrifice their complex metal sound in favour of a more punk image, but with Di'Anno at the forefront, the band could mix the two into a potent stew of classical themes, galloping metal rhythms, and speedy hardcore riffs.

      Iron Maiden was a sensation on the English rock circuit by 1978. The band had been playing for three years and gained a tremendously loyal following, but had never recorded any of their music. On New Year's Eve 1978, the band recorded one of the most famous demos in rock history, Soundhouse Tapes. Featuring only four songs, the band sold all 500 copies immediately, and did not reprint the demo again until 1996 (original copies sold for thousands of dollars). Two of the tracks on the demo, 'Prowler' and 'Iron Maiden', went straight to number one on the English metal charts.

      In several of the early Iron Maiden line-ups, Dave Murray was joined by another guitarist, but for most of 1977 and all of 1978, Murray was the sole guitarist in the band. This changed with the arrival of Tony Parsons in 1979. Drummer Doug Sampson was also replaced by the dynamic Clive Burr. In November 1979, the band landed a major record deal by signing to EMI, a partnership that would last for nearly 15 years. Shortly before going into the studio, Parsons was replaced by guitarist Dennis Stratton. Initially, the band wanted to hire Dave Murray's childhood friend Adrian Smith, but Smith was busy singing and playing guitar for his band Urchin.

      Iron Maiden was released in 1980 to critical and commercial success. The band went on to open for Kiss on their 1980 Unmasked tour, as well as opening select dates for the legendary Judas Priest. After the Kiss tour, Dennis Stratton was fired from the band as a result of creative and personal differences. Finally, the timing was right for the arrival of Adrian Smith.

      Smith brought a melodic, whimsical sound to Iron Maiden. His bluesy, experimental sound was the complete opposite of Murray's speedy, lightning fast style. One of Iron Maiden's trademarks is the double 'twin lead' harmonising guitar stylings of Murray and Smith, a style pioneered by Wishbone Ash and The Allman Brothers Band, but taken to a whole new level by Iron Maiden.

      In 1981, Maiden released their second album, titled Killers. This new album contained the first hit songs for the band and they were introduced to audiences in the United States. It was at this time when the band was the star attraction of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal, in which bands from England flooded the market of the United States. Killers remains one of the bands fastest and heaviest albums, and remains a favourite among hardcore fans.s</p>
